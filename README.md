A CutTheRope like game demo with a in-game level editor,  made with cocos2d-x 2.1.3.

The game is portable and it can run on both ios and android.

If you want to run it on your android device, you should copy directory "android"
to your cocos2dx root directory, then you can run it on your android device.


Notes:

1.Due to the lack of a cross-platform guesture regonizer.
So I don't implement a "long press" guesture. I use two tap touch event for the long press action.
If you are confused about this, you should read the follows tutorials first.

2.CCMenuAdvanced is a extension of cocos2d-iphone, but it is not available in cocos2d-x now. 
So I just use CCMenu to display level menu .
